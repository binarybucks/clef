Clef
====

Clef is an attempt to create an MPD client for Mac as there are no alternatives to the apparently unmaintained Theremin. 

What is MPD?
------------
MPD is the Music Player Daemon that allows you to have a central repository for all your music, which you can controll with a variety of clients.
For more information have a look at the [MPD project wiki](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki) 

Contributing
------------
Want to contribute? Great, please go ahead!

The code and design is faar from being perfect, so please feel free to suggest code and design improvements or file reports for bugs you have found. 
As I develop the code in my free time progress may be slow, so don't hesitate to give me a helping hand, I'll certainly appreciate it. 

Building
--------
Clef currently requires the [libmpdclient 2.7 library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/musicpd/files/libmpdclient/2.7/) to be installed locally if you want to build the project.
